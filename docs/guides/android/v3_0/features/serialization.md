# Serialization and Deserialization

Since version 3.4.2, PhotoEditorSDK's Editor UI supports serialization and deserialization of
application states. This means that you can export the current state of the editor and import
it later on.

The serialization schema is specified [here](https://static.photoeditorsdk.com/serialization/schema-1.0.1.json).

## Serialization

In order to serialize the editor state, simply call `serialize()` on the Editor instance:

```js
editor.serialize({ image: true })
  .then((state) => {
    console.log('Editor state:', state)
  })
```

This will serialize the editor state and write the result to the console.

The `image` option specifies whether or not the input image should be serialized as well. Enabling
this (which is the default) will highly increase the size of the resulting object.

## Deserialization

In order to deserialize / load an editor state, simply call `deserialize()` on the Editor instance
and pass the editor state object:

```js
editor.deserialize(state)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Restored state!')
  })
```

This will restore the editor state.
