# Getting Started with React

We created a [demo repository](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-react-demo), that uses our [React demo](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-react-demo) to integrate the PhotoEditor SDK into a React application.

>**WARNING**: The repository is not meant as a fully fledged React plugin, but as a base for further development instead. See the [React demo repository](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-react-demo) for more details on how to implement a full plugin for your use case.
