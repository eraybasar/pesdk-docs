# Getting Started with React Native

Please use our official [React Native module for PhotoEditor SDK](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-react-native) which is available via NPM as [`react-native-photoeditorsdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-photoeditorsdk). There is also an [example project](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-react-native-demo) which demonstrates how to use the React Native module for PhotoEditor SDK.

**Please note that the React Native module for PhotoEditor SDK currently supports iOS only. Android support will be part of the next major release.**
