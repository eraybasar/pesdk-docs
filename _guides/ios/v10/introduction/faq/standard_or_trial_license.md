title: What is the difference between a standard and a trial license?
---

There are two different forms of license files for PhotoEditor SDK:

1. The trial license
2. The standard license

While the standard license is valid for the time that you are our customer, the trial license is valid for 30 days only and includes a fixed expiry date that cannot be changed. You can use the trial license for testing purposes and in a staging environment, but you should not use it in production. Please keep in mind that PhotoEditor SDK will stop working after these 30 days.

Start your [30-day free trial](https://account.photoeditorsdk.com/signup/) or request a [standard license](https://account.photoeditorsdk.com/pricing/).
