title: How can I add additional features and alter my license?
---

Generally, you are not allowed to manually change anything within the license file. If you do for example add a certain feature, the license will become invalid. Therefore, please make sure to upgrade your current plan accordingly if you would like to have additional features. Please find more information about our current feature set [here](https://photoeditorsdk.com/features/).
