title: What happens if I change my app's bundle identifier?
---

If, for some reason, you have to change your project's bundle identifier, you will have to change the given bundle identifier in your dashboard accordingly. After that, you will have to add an updated license file to your project and resubmit your app to the App Store.

For more on that please refer to our documentation on how to [download and update your license file]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/{{page.platform}}/{{page.version}}/introduction/faq/download_license).
