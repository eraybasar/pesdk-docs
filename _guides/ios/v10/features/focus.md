The focus tool allows your users to add a radial or linear blur to their images that lets them mimic _Tilt Shift_ or _Bokeh_ effects.

The tool is implemented in the `FocusToolController` class and can be configured by modifying the [`FocusToolControllerOptions`]({{ site.baseurl }}/apidocs/{{page.platform}}/{{page.version}}/Classes/FocusToolControllerOptions.html) as described in the [configuration]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/{{page.platform}}/{{page.version}}/introduction/configuration) section.
It allows to change the size of the clear area and the width of the area where the transition from clear to full blur happens.
