Our Adjustment tool is our swiss army knife for image optimization. It offers essential functions like brightness and contrast while allowing more expert users to fine-tune highlights, shadows and clarity.

The tool is implemented in the `AdjustToolController` class. For your app, you can choose which functionality you'd like to make available by modifiying the [`AdjustToolControllerOptions`]({{ site.baseurl }}/apidocs/{{page.platform}}/{{page.version}}/Classes/AdjustToolControllerOptions.html) as described in the [configuration]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/{{page.platform}}/{{page.version}}/introduction/configuration) section. Using these options you can configure the sliders and buttons and react to changes to the sliders.

The default toolset consists of:

1. Brightness
2. Contrast
3. Saturation
4. Clarity
5. Shadows
6. Highlights
7. Exposure

In order to change the available tools or their order, you have to set an array of [`AdjustTool`]({{ site.baseurl }}/apidocs/{{page.platform}}/{{page.version}}/Enums/AdjustTool.html) values to the `allowedAdjustTools` property.
