title: Changing Bundle Identifiers
---

If the bundle identifiers change, you will have to change the identifiers in your dashboard. After changing the bundle identifiers, you will have to add the license file to your project and resubmit your app to the PlayStore.

Please find more information on how to download and update the license file [here]({{site.baseUrl}}/guides/android/v6_5/introduction/faq/download_license).
