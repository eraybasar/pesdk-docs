title: Missing Features / Altering the License

Generally, you are not allowed to manually change anything within the license file yourself. If you do e.g. add a certain feature, the license will become invalid. Therefore, please make sure to extend your current plan accordingly if you would like to have additional features. Please find more information about our current feature set [here](https://photoeditorsdk.com/features/).
