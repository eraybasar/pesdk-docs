Whether you just want to learn to use the PhotoEditor SDK or just see what can be built with it, we are providing some example integrations for various frameworks.

## Example app

We offer an {% include guides/android/example-app.md %} on the Play Store, that shows off the PhotoEditor SDKs interface and our default configuration.

## Demo repository
For code examples take a look at the {% include guides/android/demo-repository.md %}. This demonstrates how to integrate the PhotoEditor SDK into your Android and how to configure it to match your needs.

## Example Integrations

Check out our GitHub Repositories [here](https://github.com/imgly/) for up to date example integrations of our HTML and native SDKs. 
All example integrations repositories are tagged with the suffix `-demo`. In general, these examples are a good starting place to:

 * Quickly test out our SDK without the need to write code
 * Tinker with the code to understand how it works and
 * Starting templates for specific web frameworks.

 Currently, we are providing example integrations for:

  * [React Native](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-react-native-demo) 
  * [Ionic](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-ionic-demo)
  * [Cordova](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-cordova-demo)

We are also providing the corresponding tutorials in our quickstart section [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstarts) if you want to learn to integrate the SDK yourself. This includes:

  * [React Native]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstarts/react_native)
