We offer two different UI systems to our customers for the HTML5 platform, the BasicUI and the AdvancedUI.

## BasicUI

The BasicUI takes a vertical layout approach to feature a responsive design. It works on all screen sizes.

## AdvancedUI

The AdvancedUI is the more advanced version takes a more horizontal layout approach, which provides a better overview of tools and their controls. AdvancedUI is not supported on mobile devices.

However, to get both usability and responsiveness you can load AdvancedUI on larger screens and BasicUI on smaller screens.


Both UIs are built with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
