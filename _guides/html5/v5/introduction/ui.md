We offer two different UI systems to our customers for the HTML5 platform, the BasicUI and the AdvancedUI.

## BasicUI

The BasicUI features a responsive design, so it works on all screen sizes.

## AdvancedUI

The DesktopUI is the more advanced version with a better overview of tools and controls. AdvancedUI is not supported on mobile devices.

However to get both usibility and responsiveness you can load AdvancedUI on larger screens and Basic UI on smaller screens.


Both UIs are built with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
