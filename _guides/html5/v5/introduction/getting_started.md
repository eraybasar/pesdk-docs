## Integration Tutorial


Integrating our editor into your web application is easy as pie. However, if you can't wait  to see the editor in action you can find a working demo integration [here](https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/html5-demo).

<div class="documentation__disclaimer">
<h4 id="license-terms">Using a Trial License</h4>
Make sure you have a standard license before adding it properly to your running project. A trial license is valid for only 30 days and will afterwards disable the export function for your customers. Your trial license should therefore be removed and substituted by a standard license. More information can be found <a href="{{site.baseUrl}}/guides/html5/v5/introduction/faq/standard_or_trial_license">here</a>.
</div>

__Note:__ Since we're working with the latest web technologies, all code samples are using the
ECMAScript 6 standard. If you're using an older ECMAScript / JavaScript standard, please use
[Babel](http://babeljs.io/) to compile the examples to ES5.

## What you need

First, download the [latest release](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-html5-build/releases/latest) from our public GitHub repository and extract it.
Afterwards, you will be left with the following folder structure

```bash
├── assets
│   ├── brushes
│   ├── adjustment
│   ├── filter
│   ├── font
│   ├── frame
│   ├── overlay
│   ├── sticker
│   ├── textdesign
│   └── transform
├── esm
└── cjs
```

The package contains three folders that you need to integrate to your project.
1. `assets` folder: It contains all assets required for the PhotoEditor, this includes for example assets for *frames*, *stickers* and the *ui*.
1. `cjs` folder: It contains the PhotoEditor SDK UI bundled as commonjs modules, will be loaded for older browser versions.
1. `esm` folder: It contains the PhotoEditor SDK UI bundled as ECMAScript modules, will be loaded for supported modern browser versions.

## Integration

Copy the folders `assets`, `esm`, `cjs`, `index.js` and `index.esm.js` into your project.

Then include the SDK and the UI JavaScript files as well as the CSS files inside your `<head>` tag:


```html
<head>
  <!-- Depending on your browser load esm, cjs or umd bundles  -->
  <!-- Peer Dependencies for the SDK UI -->
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <script crossOrigin src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/styled-components/4.3.1/styled-components-macro.esm.js"></script>

  <!-- PhotoEditor SDK-->
  <script src="js/index.esm.js"></script>

</head>
```

If your browser doesn't support any of the bundles. You can use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to compile and watch the `index.html` file

{% capture identifier %}{{page.title}}-{{page.version}}-ANALYTICS{% endcapture %}
{% include multilingual_code_block.html snippets=snippets identifier=identifier %}

Now, create a `<div>` tag as a container for the editor. The editor will adapt its size according to the dimensions of the container.
For the sake of simplicity, specify the dimensions using inline styles:

```html
  <div role="main" id="editor" style="width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"></div>
```

Finally, in order to initialize the editor, instantiate the UI using JavaScript. Add the following code right below our containing `<div>` element:


```html
<script>
  window.onload = function () {
    var image = new Image()
    image.onload = function () {
        var container = document.getElementById('editor')
        var editor = new PhotoEditorSDKUI({
          container: container,
          image: image
        // Please replace this with your license: https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/dashboard/subscriptions
        engine: {
          license: '{"owner":"Imgly Inc.","version":"2.1", ...}',
          crossOrigin: 'Anonymous'
        },
        assetBaseUrl: 'assets/',
      })
    }
    // image.crossOrigin = 'Anonymous'  // Setup CORS accordingly if needed
    image.src = './example.jpg'
  }
</script>
```

{% capture identifier %}{{page.title}}-{{page.version}}-ANALYTICS-02{% endcapture %}
{% include multilingual_code_block.html snippets=snippets identifier=identifier %}

<!-- <div class="important-notice"> -->
<div class="documentation__disclaimer">
<h4 id="cors">CORS</h4> 
If you are loading images from external sources (e.g. from an AWS bucket), you need to first configure <b>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</b> for both the server and the image. <br><br>
Otherwise, you will see errors such as <br>
<b><em>Failed to execute 'texImage2D' on 'WebGLRenderingContext': The cross-origin image at [...] may not be loaded.</em></b> <br>
or <br>
<b><em> Unable to get image data from canvas because the canvas has been tainted. </em></b> <br>
<br>
Please follow the instructions on how to properly configure CORS <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/guides/html5/v5/introduction/faq/cors">here</a>.
</div>

## Ready to go!
This was all that is necessary to get the PhotoEditor SDK up and running. For simplicity here is the whole source code of  the *html* file:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- Depending on your browser load esm, cjs or umd bundles  -->
  <!-- Peer Dependencies for the SDK UI -->
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/styled-components/dist/styled-components.min.js"></script>

  <!-- PhotoEditor SDK-->
  <script src="./index.js"></script>

</head>

  <body>
    <div role="main" id="editor" style="width: 100vw; height: 100vh;"></div>
    <script>
      window.onload = function () {
        const image = new Image()
        image.onload = function () {
          const container = document.getElementById('editor')
          const editor = new PhotoEditorSDKUI({
            container: container,
            image: image,
            // Please replace this with your license: https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/dashboard/subscriptions
            engine: {
              license: '{"owner":"Imgly Inc.","version":"2.1", ...}',
              crossOrigin: 'Anonymous'
            },
            assetBaseUrl: 'assets/',
          })
        }
        // image.crossOrigin = 'Anonymous'  // Setup CORS accordingly if needed
        image.src = './example.jpg'
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

{% capture identifier %}{{page.title}}-{{page.version}}-ANALYTICS-03{% endcapture %}

Launch your favorite webserver and enjoy our editor. If you don't know which webserver to use, give `npx parcel index.html` a try.


In any case, you can find a working demo integration [here](https://www.photoeditorsdk.com).
