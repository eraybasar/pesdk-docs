You can easily configure the editor to disable specific tools, hide buttons etc. by adding properties
to the `options` object passed to the UI:

---

  * `layout` - The layout that should be loaded, default to `advanced`. Available are `advanced`, `basic`
  * `container` HTMLDivElement - The element the editor should be rendered to
  * `language` String - The UI language. Defaults to `en`. Available are `en` and `de`
  * `theme` String - Defines the theme that should be used to style the user interface. Defaults to `dark`. Available are `dark` and `light`
  * `image` String or HTMLImageElement - The image that should be loaded and displayed initially
  * `order` - rendering `toolControlBar` to right, relevant only for AdvancedUI, defaults to `default`. Available are `default` and `reverse` 
  * `assetBaseUrl` String - The base URL for all assets. Should be the absolute path to your `assets` directory, defaults to `assets`

  * `engine` Object
    * `license` String - The PESDK license. If no license (or an invalid license) is provided engine will render a watermark over the preview and export output
    * `crossOrigin` - Sets the global crossOrigin loading mode. Values: `anonymous`, `use-credentials` or `none`
    * `downscaleOptions` Object - Images whose sizes exceed these megapixel limits will be downscaled by the engine
      * `maxMegaPixels` Object - Specifies the maximum amount of megapixels per device type
        * `desktop` Number - Defaults to 10
        * `mobile` Number - Defaults to 5
      * `maxDimensions` Object - Specifies max height or width for the image
        * `height` Number
        * `width` Number

  * `defaultTool` String - The tool that is initially loaded. Defaults to `filter`
  * `mainCanvasActions` Array - Defines all allowed actions for the main screen that are displayed in the given order as buttons on the canvasBar. Available are to `undo`, `redo`, `export`, `close`, `undefined`, if `undefined` is given, based on the array index of `undefined` editor will leave that place empty
  * `snapping` Object - Options that control the snapping behaviour of sprites
    * `position` Object - Snapping options for positioning sprites
      * `enabled` Boolean - Whether sprites should snap to specific positions during pan interactions. Defaults to `true`
      * `threshold` Number - This threshold defines the distance of a pan gesture where snapping at a snap point occurs (value in pixels). Defaults to `20`
      * `snapToHorizontalCenter` Boolean - If enabled a sprite's center snaps to the horizontal line through the center of the edited image. Defaults to `true`
      * `snapToVerticalCenter` Boolean - If enabled a sprite's center snaps to the vertical line through the center of the edited image. Defaults to `true`
      * `snapToLeft` Number or null - The left side of a sprite's bounding box snaps to a vertical line which is shifted by this value rom the left side of the edited image towards its center. This value is measured in normalized coordinates relative to the smaller side of the edited image.  If this value is explicitly set to `null` this snapping line is disabled. Defaults to `0.1`
      * `snapToRight` Number or null - The right side of a sprite's bounding box snaps to a vertical line which is shifted by this value rom the right side of the edited image towards its center. This value is measured in normalized coordinates relative to the smaller side of the edited image.  If this value is explicitly set to `null` this snapping line is disabled. Defaults to `0.1`
      * `snapToTop` Number or null - The top side of a sprite's bounding box snaps to a vertical line which is shifted by this value rom the top side of the edited image towards its center. This value is measured in normalized coordinates relative to the smaller side of the edited image.  If this value is explicitly set to `null` this snapping line is disabled. Defaults to `0.1`
      * `snapToBottom` Number or null - The bottom side of a sprite's bounding box snaps to a vertical line which is shifted by this value rom the bottom side of the edited image towards its center. This value is measured in normalized coordinates relative to the smaller side of the edited image.  If this value is explicitly set to `null` this snapping line is disabled. Defaults to `0.1`
    * `rotation` Object - Snapping options for rotating sprites
      * `enabled` Boolean - Whether sprites should snap to specific orientations during rotation interactions. Defaults to `true`
      * `threshold` Number - This threshold defines the arc length of a rotation gesture where snapping at a snap angle occurs (value in pixels). Defaults to `20`
      * `angles` Number - Enabled snapping angles in degrees for rotating a sprite. The rotation angle is defined clockwise. Defaults to `[0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315]`
  * `export` Object - Export configuration if the editor supports image editing
    * `image` Object - Image export configuration if the editor supports image editing

      * `exportType` PhotoEditorSDK.RenderType - Specifies the export type (image or data url)
