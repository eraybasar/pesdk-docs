# Getting Started with Angular JS

We created a [demo repository](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-angular-demo), that uses our [Angular demo](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-angular-demo) to integrate the PhotoEditor SDK into an Angular JS application.

>**WARNING**: The repository is not meant as a fully fledged React plugin, but as a base for further development instead. See the [Angular demo repository](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-angular-demo) for more details on how to implement a full plugin for your use case.
