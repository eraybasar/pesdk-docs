Please note that we differentiate between a standard and a trial license. A trial license is valid for only 30 days and will crash your app after 30 days. If you release an app with a trial license after the trial is over, you will need to add the standard license, resubmit your app and this might take a while where your customers might not be able to use your app in the meantime. Please take this into consideration before you add a trial license to your existing app. Please [contact us](https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/pricing) if you'd like to purchase a standard license.
