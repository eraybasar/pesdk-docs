There are two different license files for the PhotoEditor SDK:

1. The trial license
2. The standard license

Whereas the standard license is valid for the time you are a customer of us, the trial license is only valid for 30 days and includes a fixed expiry date that cannot be changed. You can use the trial license for testing purposes and in the staging environment, but you are not allowed to use it in production. Please keep in mind that the PhotoEditor SDK will stop working after these 30 days.

To start your 30-days free trial and get a trial license, please click <a href="https://photoeditorsdk.com/signup/">here</a>.
To request a standard license, please click <a href="https://photoeditorsdk.com/pricing/">here</a>.
