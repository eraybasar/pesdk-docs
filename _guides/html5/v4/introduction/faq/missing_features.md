Generally, you are not allowed to manually change anything within the license file yourself. If you do e.g. add a certain feature, the license will become invalid. Therefore, please make sure that if you'd like to have an additional feature, to extend your current plan accordingly. Please find more information about our current feature set [here](https://photoeditorsdk.com/features/).
