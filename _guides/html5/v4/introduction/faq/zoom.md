Not every control supports the zooming feature at the moment, so even if you set `editor.enableZoom` to `true` when [configuring]({{site.baseUrl}}/guides/html5/v4/introduction/configuration) the editor, the zoom option will be not be available in the following controls:

* Transform
* Focus
* Text
* Text Design
* Sticker
* Brush

Zoom will be supported by more controls in the future.
