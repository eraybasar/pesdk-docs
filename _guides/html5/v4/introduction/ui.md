We offer two different UI systems to our customers for the HTML5 platform, the DesktopUI and the ReactUI.

## ReactUI

The ReactUI is our older version which features a responsive design, so it works on all screen sizes.

## DesktopUI

The DesktopUI is the more advanced version with more features than the ReactUI. Additional features include:
* Overlay 
* Text Design.

Both UIs are built with [React](https://reactjs.org).

We are currently working on a completely new UI system and will, therefore, only implement incremental changes or additions to our current UIs. At this point, we cannot give you a more advanced timeline when the new UI will be operable.
