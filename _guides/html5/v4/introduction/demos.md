Wether you just want to learn to use the PhotoEditor SDK or just see what can be build with it, we are providing some example integrations for various frameworks.

## Example Integrations

Checkout our GitHub Repositories [here](https://github.com/imgly/) for up to date example integrations of our HTML and Native SDKs.
All example intergrations repositories are tagged with the suffix `-demo`. In general these examples are a good starting place to:

 * Quickly test out our SDK without the need to write code
 * Tinker with the code to understand how it works and
 * Starting templates for specific web frameworks.


 Currently, we are providing example integrations for:

  * [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-rails-demo)
  * [Ruby on Rails Engine/Gem](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-ruby-gem-demo)
  * [React](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-react-demo)
  * [Angular](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-angular-demo)

We are also providing the corresponding tutorials in our quickstart section [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstarts), if you want to learn to integrate the SDK yourself. This includes:

  * [Ruby on Rails]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstarts/rails)
  * ...
