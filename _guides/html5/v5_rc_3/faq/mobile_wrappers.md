title: Using Mobile Wrappers with the HTML5 SDK
---

Due to technical limitations we strongly recommend using our native Android and iOS PhotoEditor SDK instead of the HTML5 PhotoEditor SDK with wrappers such as React Native, Cordova and Ionic for use on mobile devices. We can only provide limited support for such wrapper integrations.
