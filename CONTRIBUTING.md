1. Definitions
   
   1. "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with img.ly. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   2. "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to img.ly for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products or services owned or managed by img.ly (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to img.ly or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, img.ly for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."


2. Grant of Licenses

   1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to img.ly and to recipients and/or users of software distributed and/or made available by img.ly a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

   2. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to img.ly and to recipients and/or users of software distributed and/or made available by img.ly a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

5.  General
   
    1. No failure or delay by you or img.ly in exercising any right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of that right. Other than as expressly stated herein, the remedies herein are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other remedies of a party at law or in equity. Should any provision of this Agreement be held by a court to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties as to its subject matter and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement. No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the modification, amendment or waiver is to be asserted. This Agreement does not supersede or amend any existing agreement between the parties for the purchase or use of either party's products or services.
